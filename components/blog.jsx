      title: "What is Marxism and why it is the foundation of communism",
      excerpt:
        "Marxism is a political philosophy and method of socioeconomic analysis that uses a dialectical materialist interpretation of historical development, known as historical materialism, to understand class relations and social conflict. It originated in the works of 19th-century German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxism views class struggle as the central driving force of historical change, particularly between the ruling bourgeoisie and the working proletariat. It posits that capitalism, as an economic system, is flawed and will eventually fail. Marx theorized that these internal contradictions would fuel a proletarian revolution, leading to the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a socialist mode of production. For Marxists, this transition represents a necessary step towards a classless, stateless communist society.",

      title: "Reality of Capitalism",
      excerpt:
        "The actual reality of capitalism is that it often leads to inequality, social unrest, and environmental harm. While it is praised for driving innovation and economic growth, it also poses significant challenges to society. Critics argue that the pursuit of infinite profit on a finite planet is inherently unsustainable, leading to market failures and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few, which can undermine democratic processes and social cohesion.",
